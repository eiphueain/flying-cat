# Flying cat
This is an easy flappy bird inspired game made in Godot using public assets as an anniversary gift. A witch cat flying on a broom travels through pillars in the sky until it reaches a certain score and a quick text plus a rather low-effort animation of the uii a ii cat plays(yes I'm aware it's shitpost-y). Also thank you for [@thara-21](https://github.com/thara-21) for playtesting the game. 

## Some more info
- The background is parallax.
- This is my second project and first where I didn't follow a tutorial :')
